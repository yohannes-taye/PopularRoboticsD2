# INTRODUCTION

Here we will learn about the Rasberry Pi, what we can use it for and how to set it up. 

# What you will need 
## Which Raspberry PI? 
There are several models of Rasberry Pi, and for most people Rasberry Pi 4 Model B is the one to choose. Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is the newest, fastest, and easiest to use. 

Raspberry Pi 4 comes with 2 GB, 4 GB, or 8 GB of RAM. For most educational purposes and hobbyist projects, and for use as a desktop computer, 2G is enough.

  <p><strong>NOTE!<br/></strong> I should add something here about which version of Raspberry is included in the kit.</p>
</div>
Raspbery Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi Zero W, and raspberry Pi Zero WH are smaller and require less power, so they're useful for portable projects such as robots. It's generally easier to start a project with Raspberry Pi 4, and to move to Raspberry Pi Zero when you have a working prototype that a smaller Rasperry Pi would be useful for.
